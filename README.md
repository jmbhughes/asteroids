# asteroids
asteroids spin-off in Rust

I'm using this project to learn Rust. 

Based on [this tutorial](https://github.com/yishn/lets-code/tree/main/asteroids). 

# How to run
1. Clone the repo. 
2. Change into the directory. 
3. Run `cargo run`

## New features added already
- Converted to Bevy 0.10
- Fixed bullet bug where the bullet first shows up in the center of the screen


## Roadmap
- Allow lives for the ship
- Add menus
- Keep a high score (longest duration plus asteroids shot or something)
- Change shape of asteroids to something more visually interesting
- Add sound effects
- Bulid with webassembly for online play? 
- Make a more complicated game from it where you can get powerups or upgrade your ship?
